When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  While working with other team members on the same project, or accessing the Github from another PC, or just to keep my own code safe and not to loose it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe because sometimes you don't want to push yet as version to be pushed is not good.
